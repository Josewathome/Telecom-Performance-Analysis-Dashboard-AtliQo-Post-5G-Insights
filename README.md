# Project Description: AtliQo Post-5G Performance Dashboard

In this project, I delved into the world of telecom analytics, specifically focusing on AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India. Leveraging Power BI, I meticulously crafted a comprehensive dashboard that illuminated the company's performance landscape after the introduction of its 5G plans.

## Key Features:

### Interactive Insights: The dashboard offers interactive slicers and filters, allowing users to customize their view by selecting "Before and After 5G," "Month," and "City" parameters.
### Essential Metrics: Prominent metrics such as Average Revenue, Avg ARPU, Monthly Active Users, and Monthly Unsubscribed Users are visualized as cards, providing a quick overview.
### Comparative Analysis: Key metrics are dissected city-wise, showcasing performance metrics before and after the 5G launch. The percentage change is highlighted, offering directional insights.
### Trend Visualizations: Line graphs track the journey of metrics over months, providing a visual narrative of trends during the "Before and After 5G" periods.
### Market Share Exploration: A dedicated section unravels market share dynamics with a trend line graph and a stacked bar graph for companies' market shares.
### Performance KPIs: The dashboard unveils AtliQo's Total Market Value before and after 5G, alongside the User Growth Rate, offering strategic KPI insights.
### Revenue Distribution: A bar graph elucidates revenue distribution across different telecom plans, aiding understanding of revenue sources.
### Conversion Rate Key: The dashboard provides a key for easy interpretation of values, converting figures like revenue to crore and lakh units.

This project equips stakeholders and decision-makers with actionable insights, facilitating data-driven strategies in a dynamic telecom landscape.
